# Showfile snapshot diff

Visual diff for two `susan_summary` snapshot logs — what changed in the showfile
between one capture and the next.

`susan_summary` is a [disguise](https://www.disguise.one/) d3 plugin that
periodically captures a JSON snapshot of the showfile — transports, tracks,
layers, media and cues — to disk. This repo doesn't produce those snapshots;
it just reads two of the plugin's JSON captures and renders a semantic tree
diff between them, so you can see what actually changed in a show over time
without combing through raw JSON.

## Use it

This is designed to run entirely in the browser, client-side, with no build
step and no server. Use it hosted at **https://macswg.github.io/d3_snapshot_diff/**,
or open `index.html` locally straight from disk — both work identically since
nothing leaves the browser.

Pick a **Before** and an **After** (click or drag), and read the tree. That's
the whole thing.

**Choose folder…** does it in one step: point it at a captures directory and it
loads the two most recent snapshots, previous into Before and latest into After.
Order comes from the timestamp at the head of the filename
(`2026-07-18_20-17-27_…`), falling back to the file's own date for names without
one — the toolbar says how many were ordered that way.

## Reading the output

| sigil | meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `+`   | present in After, not Before |
| `−`   | present in Before, not After |
| `~`   | present in both, with changed fields |
| `↕`   | on both setlists, in a different place (running order only) |

Changes nest: a changed track lists its changed cues and layers, and a changed
layer lists its changed media. Unchanged entities are omitted entirely — the
tally in the toolbar counts every node in the tree, including nested ones.

### Setlists are not the showfile

A capture's top-level `tracks` array is only the union of what the setlists
reference, so editing a setlist changes which tracks are in the file at all.
Read naively that is a wall of deletions: dropping a hundred songs from a
setlist used to report as a hundred tracks removed from the show, which is not
what happened and buried the two edits that were real.

So **an added or removed track always means the showfile**, never the setlist.
Setlist membership is reported where it belongs — as lines on the transport's
running order.

Telling those apart needs a capture that knows the whole show. v5 captures one:
`showfile.trackIds`, which the plugin reads off the **automatic setlist**
resource — the setlist that holds every track in the show — regardless of what
any transport is loaded with. A track that leaves that list really was deleted,
and is reported as such.

`trackIds` is `null`, never `[]`, when the plugin could not read that resource:
an empty show and an unreadable one are opposite answers, and conflating them
would report every track in the show as deleted. On `null` the viewer falls back
to a transport that happens to be sitting on `automatic`, whose `trackRefs` are
the same census by a less reliable route. With neither, the question is
unanswerable, and the viewer says so in a note above the tree rather than
guessing:

> Not counted as deletions: 68 tracks that left the capture by dropping off a
> setlist. The After capture carries no census of the showfile, which is the
> only thing that lists every track in the show, so this pair cannot tell a
> showfile edit from a setlist edit.

Before v5 that fallback was the *only* route, which made the answer depend on
what someone happened to have loaded when the timer fired — the reason a capture
taken three minutes later could report 68 phantom deletions.

### Tracks in the trash

d3 keeps a deleted track under `trash/`, and a setlist can go on referencing it.
It plays like any other song, and it is never in the census — so without being
told, nothing in the output gives it away.

v5 captures `trashed` per track, and both tabs say so: the tree marks it on the
track's row and reports a track moving to the trash as a change like any other,
and the media report badges it in the removed colour next to the track name.
Searching `trash` in the media report answers "does any setlist still play
something I deleted", which is the question worth asking.

For the same reason `trackCount` is never printed under that name. At snapshot
level it reads **tracks in setlists** and at transport level **tracks in
setlist**, because that is what it counts — a show with 127 tracks and one
25-track setlist loaded reports 59, not 127.

### Running order

A transport's setlist is rendered as a collapsible block, one track per line,
rather than as two `a > b > c` strings — a setlist runs past a hundred entries
and the joined form was unreadable exactly when it mattered. Each line carries
its position on both sides:

```
running order  126 → 25 tracks  −101  ↕13 moved  12 in place
   1   ·  −  000_pipe
  10  12  ↕  120_liquid_outlaw
  19   7     150_bells_for whom the bell tolls
```

Positions are 1-based and `·` means absent from that side. Tracks on both
setlists are matched by a longest-common-subsequence pass, so a reshuffle reads
as `↕ moved` lines rather than as a hundred removals paired with a hundred
additions somewhere further down. Blocks over twelve lines start collapsed, and
open automatically while a search is running.

### Summary

Above the tree, three columns: what changed per entity type, the fields that
changed most often, and the tracks carrying the most changes.

**The field ranking is the part worth reading first.** A pair of captures can
report hundreds of changes and mean very little: if 205 of them are `media
version`, that is a re-link or re-scan, not editorial work. The headline
add/remove/change counts cannot tell those apart; the field ranking can, and it
says so outright when one field dominates.

## Media report

The second tab is not a diff. It is a plain inventory of the **After snapshot
alone** — what this show loads, setlist by setlist — and it ignores Before
entirely. It answers "what plays, and which version", which the diff
deliberately never says.

A section per transport, tracks in that setlist's running order, and under each
track one row per media file: filename, version, layer, flags, and the layer's
in and out times. Rows are in timeline order, so reading down a track is
reading the track. Tracks start collapsed — a 126-track setlist would otherwise
open some 1,700 rows — and the closed line still gives length, bpm and media
count, which is usually the question. `expand all` per transport when it isn't.

The version column is fixed-width and aligned across every track in the report,
because running an eye down it is the point.

Some deliberate differences from the diff tab:

- **A track on two setlists is listed under both**, and its media counted
  twice. The diff does the opposite for good reason — one edit reported twice
  is a wrong answer — but here the question is "what does this setlist play",
  and a song in two shows is loaded for both.
- **Every transport is included**, `automatic` among them. With an automatic
  transport loaded that section is the whole showfile, which is a report worth
  having.
- **It works with only After loaded.** The diff needs two snapshots; an
  inventory needs one.
- A setlist entry with no track in the capture renders as a marked stub rather
  than being dropped.

`mediaReport(snap)` builds it, is DOM-free like the rest of `diff.js`, and is
covered by the self-test.

## Search

One box, serving whichever tab is showing; the query survives a switch between
them.

On the tree it filters as you type, over everything you can read on a row —
labels, field names, and both values. Space-separated terms are ANDed, and each
term may match anywhere on the path from the top-level node down, so `whiskey
cue` finds the cues inside `290_whiskey_whiskey` even though no cue's own text
contains "whiskey". Track titles inside a running order are searchable too,
folded or not.

On the media report it matches track names, filenames, versions and layer names.
A track that matches shows all its media; a track kept only because one of its
media matched is dimmed as context, and filtered tracks open themselves.

In both, a row kept only to place a match further down is dimmed: it is context,
not a hit. The count is of actual hits. Escape clears.

## Logs on a shared drive

Google Drive for desktop mounts Drive as an ordinary folder
(`~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-<account>/…` on macOS,
`G:\My Drive\…` on Windows), so **Choose folder…** picks a shared captures
directory exactly like a local one — the picker never learns it is a network
mount. Dropbox, OneDrive and an SMB share all work the same way.

One caveat: files Drive is holding *online only* have no bytes on disk, and
reading one can stall or fail. Right-click the captures folder → **Available
offline** and that stops.

There is deliberately no Drive API integration. It would need OAuth, client
credentials and a server to hold them — a build step and a deployment, for the
sole benefit of not clicking a file. If a browser-side Drive picker ever
genuinely matters, that is the moment to reconsider, not before.

## Semantic, not textual

Entities are matched by **identity, never array position**:

| entity    | identity                               |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| track     | `id`, which v5 derives from its resource path |
| layer     | `groupPath` + `name`, within its track |
| media     | `path` (falls back to `name`)          |
| cue       | `beat`                                 |
| transport | `name`                                 |

A layer inserted at the top of a track is therefore **one addition**, not "every
layer below it moved". That is the whole reason this exists instead of `diff`.

Consequences worth knowing:

- **Tracks shared between setlists diff once.** The schema stores each track once
  in a top-level `tracks` array with transports holding `trackRefs`; a track on
  two setlists produces one node, not one per referencing transport.
- **A reordered setlist is a real change.** `trackRefs` order is compared as
  running order, so a reshuffled show reports even when no track in it was
  touched — but as transport lines, never as track adds and deletes. See
  [Setlists are not the showfile](#setlists-are-not-the-showfile).
- **Media swaps read as remove + add**, not `path: old → new`, because media
  identity *is* the path. A different clip is a different resource, not an
  edited one.
- **Derived counters are not compared.** `layerCount` on a track follows from
  `layers`; comparing it as well would report every structural edit twice.
  (`trackCount` *is* compared, at both levels, where it summarises a `trackRefs`
  change usefully — printed as "tracks in setlist(s)", since that is what it
  counts.)
- **Floats compare with a 1e-6 tolerance.** Beats and times are re-derived
  through the director each capture, so a position that comes back as
  `60.0000000001` is the same position, not an edit.

## Schema

Reads **v5 only**, and refuses anything else at load with a message naming the
version. There is deliberately no back-compatibility, including with v4.

A v1 log has a top-level `transport` with tracks inline rather than referenced,
so identity matching cannot line up at all. v4 is subtler and worse: it lines up
and lies quietly. Its track ids are display names disambiguated with a ` #2`
counter minted in capture order, so two tracks sharing a name can swap ids
between runs and report one whole track removed and another added for a showfile
where nothing moved. It also has no `showfile` census, so it cannot tell a
deleted track from one dropped off a setlist. Rendering either is worse than
refusing.

v5 fixes both at the source: ids key on the track's resource path, and the
census is captured explicitly.

Bump the check in `index.html` alongside `SCHEMA_VERSION` in the plugin's
`snapshot.py`, and add any new comparable fields to the field lists at the top
of `diff.js`.

## Layout

```
index.html        UI, both tabs, rendering and file loading. All the CSS.
diff.js           The engine. No DOM access — usable from node.
tools/selftest.js Regression checks against real captures.
tools/deploy.sh   Version bump, commit, push, wait for Pages.
```

`diff.js` exports `diffSnapshots(a, b)` under CommonJS as well as defining it
globally for the page, which is why the self-test can `require` it directly.

`diffSnapshots` returns:

```js
{
  meta:   { a: {capturedAt, project, version}, b: {…} },
  counts: { added, removed, changed },
  notes:  [ "Not counted as deletions: …" ],   // what the diff withheld, and why
  nodes:  [ { kind, entity, label, detail?,
              changes?: [{field, from, to}],
              order?:   { entries: [{kind, id, a, b}], counts: {…} },  // transports
              children?: [] } ]
}
```

`order` is a running order rather than a field change, because it is a list and
the page renders it a line at a time. Entry `kind` is `same`, `moved`, `added`
or `removed`; `a` and `b` are 0-based positions on each side, `null` where
absent. Its lines are deliberately not nodes and do not enter `counts` — a
reshuffled setlist is one edit, and letting a hundred lines into the tally would
drown out everything else. They do weigh in `hotspots`, where "which setlist
took the most damage" is the question being asked.

`notes` is non-empty whenever the diff declined to report something. A quieter
tally earned by withholding has to say so, or it reads as "nothing happened".

`entity` is one of `snapshot`, `transport`, `track`, `layer`, `cue`, `media`.
It is carried on the node rather than parsed back out of the label, so the
summary never has to guess what a row is.

`mediaReport(snap)` builds the media tab from a single snapshot, and is likewise
DOM-free:

```js
{
  transports: [ { name, setlist, trackCount, mediaCount, tracks: [
    { id, name, lengthInSec, bpm, missing?, items: [
      { layer, group, type, renderEnable, tStart, tEnd,
        name, path, version, hasAudio, regionSet } ] } ] } ],
  totals: { transports, tracks, media }
}
```

`items` is one row per media, not per layer, sorted by `tStart` with nulls last.
`missing` marks a `trackRefs` entry with no track in the capture.

`summarize(result)` rolls the diff tree up for the panel on the page, and is
likewise DOM-free:

```js
{
  entities: [ {entity, added, removed, changed, total} ],   // fixed display order
  fields:   [ {entity, field, count} ],                     // most-changed first
  hotspots: [ {label, kind, entity, count} ]                // top-level, heaviest first
}
```

## Deploying

GitHub Pages serves `main` at the repo root with no build step, so pushing is
the deploy. Do it through the script rather than by hand:

```
tools/deploy.sh "commit message"                 # patch: 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
tools/deploy.sh minor "commit message"           # 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
LOGS=/path/to/captures tools/deploy.sh "…"       # gate on the selftest
```

It bumps the version in the footer, commits, tags `vX.Y.Z`, pushes, then polls
the live page until it serves the new version — the Pages build API lags behind
the CDN, so the served file is the only honest signal that a deploy landed.

The version lives in exactly one place, the `#ver` span in `index.html`, and is
rewritten by the script. Don't edit it by hand; a footer nobody remembers to
update is worse than none, because it looks authoritative while being wrong.

The selftest gates the deploy when it can find captures to run against —
`LOGS`, or `../d3plg_susan_summary/example_logs` by default. If neither exists
the script warns and deploys anyway rather than blocking on a machine that
simply doesn't have the logs checked out.

## Tests

```
node tools/selftest.js [path/to/logs]
```

Defaults to `../d3plg_susan_summary/example_logs`. It needs at least two `.json`
captures there and compares the first against the last.

The cases run against **real captures rather than hand-written fixtures**,
because the fields that actually break are the ones nobody thinks to fake — null
timecode on a track with no TC tag, empty `media` arrays on a layer with no clip
assigned, tracks shared across transports. Each check corresponds to a claim
made above: identity, positional independence, shared-track dedup, float
tolerance, derived counters, running order, setlist-versus-showfile.

The setlist cases are the exception to fixture-free: they mark a transport
`automatic` and rewrite its `trackRefs` before comparing. Whether a capture
censuses the showfile is the whole question those cases ask, so it has to be set
rather than hoped for — the corpus a given machine has checked out may have no
automatic transport in it at all.

## Known gaps

- The diff is changed-only. Unchanged entities are never emitted, so there is no
  way to show surrounding context the way `diff -U` does.
- Only two snapshots at a time. A folder-wide timeline ("show me this project
  across the week") would need a different UI and is not built.
